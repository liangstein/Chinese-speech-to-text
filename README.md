## Chinese-speech-to-text
Speech recognition trained by [THCHS30 open Chinese speech database](http://data.cslt.org/thchs30/standalone.html).

## Dependency
* Python3.6(numpy, scipy, pickle, h5py, librosa),
* Keras2.02,
* Tensorflow v1.1 backend, (Not tested with Theano backend)
* Cuda8.0, Cudnn6.0 (If GPU is used)

## Neural Network Implementation
The neural network used is Wavenet, which is firstly raised in [Deepmind's paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03499). The recognition is done on character level (no need to vectorizing 10000 words), therefore the dimension is much smaller than recurrent neural network. The structure is [Here](https://github.com/liangstein/Chinese-speech-to-text/blob/master/model.png).

The training dataset is small (only 10000 samples), and the ctc loss is decreased to 0.2768 after 124 epochs. The training time on a GTX 1080 is 15 hours.

We test the recognition ability using the audio files from test set. Although the training dataset is small (10000 samples), it can recognize key words already. Right now the model isn't trained for recognitions in noisy environments. Larger and more complex training dataset can have better recognition results.
